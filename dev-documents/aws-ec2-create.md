## Create an AWS EC2 instance
- [ ] Log into AWS console.
- [ ] Select a region from the dropdown list in the top right corner. For example, us-east-1 or us-east-2. 
- [ ] Click on "EC2" or use the search bar to find it.
- [ ] Click on the orange "Launch instance" button
  - **Name and tags**
    - Enter a name for the EC2 instance.
  - **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image)**
      - **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**
        - Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For example, Amazon Linux or Ubuntu.
      - **Architecture**
        - Confirm the selected architecture.
  - **Instance Type**
    - Select an instance type. For example, t2.micro or t2.small.
  - **Key pair (login)**
    - Select a Key pair. If you don't already have one, click on "Create new key pair" and do the following.
    - Give it a meaningful name. Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes to keep names in a nice, standard format.
    - Choose RAS or ED25519. You will also use this to access your git repos.
      - This will download a .pem file.
        - Copy this fil to your desired directory. I like to user ~/Documents.
        - Set the permissions on the .pem file.
          - chmod 400 yourdomain_key.pem
        - Connect to the EC2 instance.
          - ssh -i "my-key-pair.pem" ubuntu@your_instance_public_ip
- **Network settings**
    - **VPC**
      - Select the VPC that you created earlier created.
    - **Subnet**
      - For most use cases and especially for prototyping you probably don't need a subnet for a development project. 
    - **Auto-assign public IP**
      - Select "Enable". 
    - **Firewall (security groups)**
      - If you haven't created a security groups, do so now because the AWS default security group is often too permissive by default and lacks specific rules, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
        - Follow the instructions in aws-security-group-create.md
        - Click on "Select existing security group".
        - Make sure your security groups include SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS access. You can modify security groups even after the EC2 instance is created.
  - **Configure storage**
    - Accept the values that are shown. 
- [ ] Click on the orange "Create instance" button.
    
#### \* We should have used an Elastic IP address when we created this EC2 instance instead of auto-assigning an IP address. To associate an Elastic IP address with this EC2 instance follow the instructions in aws-elastic-ip-address-allocate.md.

#### \* Before proceeding to the next step you'll have to request an SSL certification and apply it to your server. The instructions for how to do this are in aws-certificate-acm-request.md
