## Create an AWS VPC
- [ ] Log into AWS console.
- [ ] Select a region from the dropdown list in the top right corner. For example, us-east-1 or us-east-2. 
- [ ] Click on "VPC" or use the search bar to find it.
- [ ] Click on the orange "Create VPC" button.
  - **Resources to create**
    - Select "VPC and more".
  - **Name tag auto-generation**
    - Select "Auto-generate" and enter a name. "-vpc" will automatically be appended to the name.
  - **IPv4 CIDR block**
    - Change the first number instead of just using the default because everyone uses the default. So use something like 15.0.0.0/20.
  - **IPv6 CIDR block**
    - Check "No IPv6 CIDR block"
  - **Tenancy**
    - Leave selected as "Default"
  - **Encryption settings**
    - No changes.
  - **Availability Zones**
    - Select "2"
  - **Number of public subnets**
    - Leave at "2"
  - **Number of private subnets**
    - Leave at "2"
  - **NAT gateways ($)**
    - Don't select NAT gateways. This allows resources in private subnets to initiate outgoing calls to the public internet. This costs $$$.
  - **VPC endpoints**
    - Select "S3 Gateway". This is private back channel so you don't need to go out though the public subnet. All traffic stays in the AWS network. I believe there is no charge for the S3 gateway.
  - **DNS options**
    - Select both "Enable DNS hostnames" and "Enable DNS resolution".
  - **Additional tags**
    - You don't need to do anything with this.
- [ ] Click on the orange "Create VPC" button.
